    "After the block is moved as an input, a 2 is generated at a random location. (Use `Screen::create()`.)\n",
    "After random create, print the current blocks. (Use `Screen::draw()`)\n",

    "Or, if a key other than `W A S D` (up/down/left/right) is input, print the current score and the program ends.\n",
