# 1. Contacts Manager

We want to develop the address book we created last assignment(week-2, contacts).

Refer to the given skeleton code and complete the program to work correctly.

The assignment directory structure should be follow:

- week-3
    - contacts
        - contacts.cc // Code you need to complete
        - contacts.h  // Definition of contacts type
        - student.h   // Definition of student type
        - utility.h   // memory allocator

You only need to edit the `contacts.cc` file.

Find the commented `TODO:` flag in the code to complete the function.
The code you implement should satisfy the following comment of each function.

The function signature to be implemented is as follows.


```python
bool add(student_t student);
bool add(int id, std::string name);
bool add(int id, std::string name, std::string phone);
bool add(int id, std::string name, std::string phone, std::string mail);

bool remove(int id);

bool update(int id, std::string name, std::string phone, std::string mail);

student_t find(int id);

size_t size();
```


```python

```
