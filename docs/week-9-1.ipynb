    "**Person** class has a name (`name`, *std::string*) and a current asset (`assets`, int).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vehicle** class has vector variables that contain maximum speed (`max_speed`, *float*), current speed (`cur_speed`, *float*), maximum number of passengers (`max_passengers`, *int*), and passengers (`passengers`, *vector < Person >*).\n",
    "Methods include `start`, `stop`, `get_in`, `get_off` and `size`. `start` makes the current speed the maximum speed, and `stop` makes the current speed zero. `size` return count of current passengers. `get_in` and `get_off` have different implementations depending on the class they inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Car** class inherits from the **Vehicle** class. It also has an owner variable (`owner`, Person). In the `get_in` function, you can ride if the person you want to ride is the owner or if the owner already rides. `get_off` is when the owner gets off, all passengers should get off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bus** class inherits from the **Vehicle** class. It also has an charge variable (`charge`, int). In bus class, when `start` is called, the current speed becomes half of the maximum speed. You can get on board with `get_in` function and get off with `get_off` function. However, there is also overloading of `get_in` and `get_off`, which can be boarded or get off as a group. These functions take a `std::vector<Person&>` as an argument. All passengers on the bus will have their `assets` reduced by bus's `charge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Taxi** class inherits the vehicle class and has a charge variable (`charge`, int). In the taxi class, multiple people can get on and off like the bus class, but additional boarding is not allowed when there are passengers. In addition, taxi class passengers also have to pay a charge, but pay when getting off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, passengers in all vehicles cannot exceed the maximum number of passengers (`max_passengers`). When boarding as a group, the **Bus** can accommodate part of the group up to the maximum number of passengers, but **Taxi* will not take all of them if even part of the group cannot."
